# Exercise 1: Rewrite and Optimize a Vague Prompt

## 🎯 Objective
Learn to identify critical issues in vague prompts and rewrite them using best practices in prompt engineering.

## 📋 Scenario
You're an AI Prompt Engineer at a productivity startup. Your manager asks you to use ChatGPT to create a LinkedIn post promoting their new focus app, **FlowNest**. They send you this vague prompt:

> **"Write something about productivity tips."**

## ✅ Tasks

### Task 1: Identify Critical Issues
Identify **3 critical issues** with this prompt.

**Hint:** Think about:
- Brand voice
- Target users
- Platform engagement
- Specific goals
- Format requirements

#### Your Answer:
```
1. Issue 1: Missing Brand Context - No mention of FlowNest or its unique value proposition.
2. Issue 2: No Audience Targeting - Unclear who the content is for (students, professionals, entrepreneurs?) and doesn't consider LinkedIn's professional audience.
3. Issue 3: Lack of Platform-Specific Requirements - No engagement hooks (questions, CTAs) or format constraints (LinkedIn post length, hashtags).
```

### Task 2: Rewrite Using Three Techniques
Rewrite the prompt using **all three techniques**:

1. **Role prompting** (e.g., "Act as a…")
2. **Instruction-based prompting** (e.g., "Give 3 actionable…")
3. **Format/tone/length constraint** (e.g., "Use bullet points" or "max 280 characters")

#### Your Rewritten Prompt:
```
Act as a social media marketing specialist with expertise in B2C SaaS promotion and LinkedIn engagement strategies.

Create a LinkedIn post promoting FlowNest, our new focus app designed for remote professionals struggling with digital distractions.

Requirements:
1. Hook: Start with a relatable question or pain point about focus/productivity.
2. Value Proposition: Highlight FlowNest's unique AI-powered distraction blocking feature.
3. Social Proof: Mention "Join 10,000+ professionals" to build credibility.
4. Call-to-Action: Include a link to the free trial with urgency ("Limited beta spots").

Format & Constraints:
- Length: 150-200 words.
- Tone: Professional yet conversational.
- Structure: Hook (1-2 lines) + 3 bullet points + CTA.
- Include: 3-5 relevant hashtags (#productivity #remotework #focusapp).
- Emoji usage: 2-3 strategic emojis.
```

### Task 3: Make It Reusable
Add a final line that makes the prompt reusable for future productivity tool promotions.

#### Your Reusable Template Line:
```
Use this format whenever promoting productivity tools on social media: [HOOK: Pain point/question] + [SOLUTION: Product feature] + [PROOF: User count/testimonial] + [CTA: Specific action with urgency].
```
