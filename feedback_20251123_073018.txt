suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for invalid suit or value inputs when creating a `Card` object, although not explicitly required, it's good practice.
- The shuffle method could be made more robust by ensuring it always rebuilds the deck if cards are missing, rather than just printing a message.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code only provides answers to the quiz questions. It needs to implement the Deck of Cards class as described in Exercise 2.
- Include code for the Card and Deck classes with the specified methods (shuffle and deal).
