suggestions for improvement:
- For Exercise 1, include the predictions in the comments within the code, as requested. Also, address what would happen if 'const' were used instead of 'let', as asked in the exercise.
- In Exercise 7, the instruction was to add a div to the navbar within the HTML file. The current solution only logs a message to the console. Implement the DOM manipulation to add the div element to the navbar.
