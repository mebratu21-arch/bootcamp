suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code addresses a different set of exercises related to timers and animations, which are not present in the provided chapter content. Therefore, the code is entirely irrelevant to the specified exercises.
- The exercise is focused on DOM manipulation, event handlers and forms. The submission does not address these topics.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to explain complex logic, especially in the bonus sections of Exercise 1, to improve readability for other developers.
- The code could benefit from more robust error handling, for example, checking if the paragraph element exists before attaching event listeners in Exercise 3.
