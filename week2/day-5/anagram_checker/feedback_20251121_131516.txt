suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to each method to explain their purpose and parameters.
- The `create_sample_word_list` function is helpful for testing but might be removed or made optional in a production environment.
- For very large word lists, consider optimizing `get_anagrams` by pre-computing the sorted form of each word in the word list during initialization to avoid repeated sorting.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling, such as specific exceptions for file loading issues in AnagramChecker.
- The UI could be enhanced with more informative messages or visual cues to guide the user.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, which is completely unrelated to the chapter's content about anagram checking, OOP, file I/O, and string manipulation.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is just a list of words, and it does not implement any of the functionalities described in the chapter content, such as creating the `AnagramChecker` class, implementing the methods `is_valid_word`, `is_anagram`, and `get_anagrams`, or creating the user interface in `anagrams.py`. The submission does not address the problem.
