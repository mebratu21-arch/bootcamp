Brief justification:
- correctness: The code fully addresses the prompt. It correctly implements the Farm class with all the required methods: `__init__`, `add_animal` (including the `**kwargs` upgrade), `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, and `get_short_info`. The output matches the examples, and the bonus features are correctly implemented.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Docstrings are used effectively to explain the purpose of each class and method. Variable names are descriptive.
- performance: The code is efficient, using appropriate data structures (dictionaries) and algorithms (sorting). There are no obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external input or potentially unsafe operations. It appears to be secure.
