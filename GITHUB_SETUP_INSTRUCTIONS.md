## 🎯 Step-by-Step Setup

### **Step 1: Create the Profile Repository**

GitHub profile READMEs require a special repository with **the same name as your username**.

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Set repository name to: **`mebratu21-arch`** (exactly your username)
3. Make it **Public**
4. ✅ Check "Add a README file"
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Add the Profile README**

1. Open the newly created repository
2. Click on the **`README.md`** file
3. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) to edit
4. **Delete all existing content**
5. **Copy the entire content** from `PROFILE_README.md` (the file I created)
6. **Paste it** into the GitHub editor
7. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**
8. Add commit message: `feat: Add professional profile README`
9. Click **"Commit changes"**

### **Step 3: Customize Your Information**

Before committing, update these placeholders with your real information:

```markdown
# Find and replace these:

https://mebratu21-arch.github.io → your-portfolio-url (if you have one)
