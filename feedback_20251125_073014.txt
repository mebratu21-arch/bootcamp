suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 5, the bonus condition `if (container.style.backgroundColor === "lightblue")` might not work as expected because `container.style.backgroundColor` returns the computed style, which might be in a different format (e.g., 'rgb(173, 216, 230)') instead of 'lightblue'. To fix this, you can directly compare with the string 'lightblue' or normalize it to a common format.
- In Exercise 7, the images are all coming from the same url. Update the data to use real unique urls.
