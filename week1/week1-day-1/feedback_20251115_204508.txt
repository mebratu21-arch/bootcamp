Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses each exercise as described in the instructions. Each section is clearly labeled, and the solutions correctly implement the requested functionality, covering print statements, variables, mathematical operations, comparison operators, if statements, and user input. All instructions are followed precisely.
- readability: The code is very readable due to the use of clear comments, descriptive variable names, and consistent formatting. Each exercise is separated by a header, making it easy to understand and follow.
- performance: The code is performant as it uses basic operations and appropriate data types for each task. There are no unnecessary loops or complex calculations that would impact performance.
- security: The code includes error handling for user input in exercises 7 and 9 to prevent `ValueError` exceptions, which enhances the security and robustness of the program.
