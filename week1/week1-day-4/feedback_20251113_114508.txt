Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses and completes each exercise as described in the prompt.  Each function behaves as expected, and the outputs match the examples given. Bonus objectives (floating point temperature) are also correctly implemented. Step 5, Month Based seasons were not implemented but weren't required either.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. Comments are used effectively to denote the start of each exercise and the steps within each exercise, making the code very readable.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods for each task (e.g., list comprehension for Exercise 6, random.uniform for Exercise 7's bonus). There are no unnecessary loops or computations.
- security: The code does not take any external user input, so there are no concerns about code injection or other input-related vulnerabilities.  The `random` module is used safely.
