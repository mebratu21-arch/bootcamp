Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses each exercise as described in the chapter content. Exercise 1 correctly converts lists into a dictionary using `zip`. Exercise 2 calculates movie ticket costs based on age and incorporates conditionals and looping. Exercise 3 manipulates a dictionary representing the Zara brand, including adding, deleting, and modifying keys and values, and merges dictionaries as per the bonus. Exercise 4 successfully creates different dictionaries from a list of Disney characters based on index and alphabetical order. All exercises fulfill the instructions completely.
- readability: The code is well-organized and easy to understand, with clear comments and meaningful variable names. Consistent indentation and spacing enhance readability.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods for each task. Dictionary comprehensions and built-in functions like `zip`, `enumerate`, `sorted`, and `update` are used appropriately, making the code performant.
- security: The code does not involve user input (except potentially in the bonus part of exercise 2 which is not included), so there are no inherent security risks. The code uses best practices and avoids any potential vulnerabilities.
