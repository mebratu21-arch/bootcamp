suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding input validation for age in Exercise 9 to ensure non-negative integers.
- For clarity, you could add comments to explain the purpose of each section in Exercise 9, especially the bonus part.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all exercises according to the provided instructions, including set operations, tuple handling, list manipulations, loop usage, and conditional logic. The bonus part of Exercise 9 is also implemented correctly.
- readability: The code is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear section headers and comments explaining each exercise. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly indented.
- performance: The code is efficient for the given tasks, with appropriate use of built-in functions and data structures. The loops are optimized for the required iterations.
- security: The code appears secure, with no obvious vulnerabilities. Input validation is present in Exercise 6, preventing non-string names. Further input validation could be added in other exercises where numerical input is expected.
